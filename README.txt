Object oriented programming seperates our code to different objects
OOP created by classes not the object literals
Constructor is first function running when instantiating the class 
Abstraction is hiding the complexity and only interact with it 
Abstraction like life cycle methods in class based component
Encapsulation is protecting the class fields by making it private
Inheritance When class inherit the properties and methods from another class
Polymorphism means that class can take many forms
